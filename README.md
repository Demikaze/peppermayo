# Pepper Mayo — Simple Link Manager

A minimal static site that lets you add links to other websites. Links are stored in your browser using localStorage.

Project notes
- Page title is "Pepper Mayo" and the default button text in your index.html is "https://peppermayo.i143.xyz".
- Storage is local to the browser and device (localStorage). If you want sync across devices, we can add a backend or a cloud DB (Firebase, Supabase, a small server, etc.).

Files to add
- index.html (you've provided this)
- styles.css
- script.js
- README.md

Usage
1. Put all files in the same folder (root or a folder you prefer).
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to use locally, or host via GitHub Pages:
   - Commit files and push to your repo (main branch or a feature branch).
   - In the repo Settings → Pages, set Source to the branch/folder and publish.

Quick git commands (example)
```bash
git add index.html styles.css script.js README.md
git commit -m "Add Pepper Mayo simple link manager"
git push origin main
```
